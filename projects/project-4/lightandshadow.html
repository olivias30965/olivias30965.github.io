                            <h4>Devon Chen (b. 1990, Vancouver, Canada)</h4>
                            <p>Chen is a multimedia artist whose work investigates the intersections between projection, light, and technology. Her practice is grounded in its exploration of digital and analog methods, questioning issues of materiality and perception. Chen's work has been featured in numerous exhibitions across North America and Europe, and she continues to challenge our understanding of what art can be in an increasingly digital world.</p>
                            <p>After studying computer programming before studying video art, Chen brings a unique skill set and creative vision to the field. Chen's pioneering work is often noted as boundary-crossing, creating conversations about the relationship between the artist and the viewer through interactive installations. Chen's work has been presented in the Venice Biennale's emerging artists showcase series (2020).</p>
                            <p>Chen currently teaches in Toronto, where the two was established an innovative laboratory for her work and artistic experimentation.</p>

                            <p>Ayako Watanabe works across painting, installation, and traditional Japanese media to explore the aesthetics of shadow and silence. Influenced by the philosophy of “ma”—the Japanese concept of negative space—her installations often combine ink painting with carefully choreographed light sources to evoke memory, absence, and impermanence. </p>
                            <p>Watanabe studied through traditional Japanese painting yet is a curator at the Guggenheim by the pioneering works of projection mapping as an artistic medium. Her practice brings a contemporary and critical perspective to both traditional and new media.</p>
